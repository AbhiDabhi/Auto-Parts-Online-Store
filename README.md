# Auto-Parts
The purpose of this project is to create an online auto parts store that allows customers to search and purchase the auto parts over the Internet instead of going to the local Auto_Parts or Walmart/Amazon, which is much more convenient and popular in todayâ€™s world.

Our website features an impressive and user-friendly interface for the online shopping. The auto-parts are classified by different categories. After a free and quick membership registration, the user can add the selected auto-parts into the shopping cart and continue to check out with a price and also can review the purchase history and order details in his account as well.
